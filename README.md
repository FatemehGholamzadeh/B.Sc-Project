Air Pollution Forecasting for Tehran City using Vector Auto Regression - B.Sc. Project - Fall 2020  
## Abstract   
Recently, in many urban areas, air quality has 
decreased because of human activities such as biomass burning 
and development of industrialization. There are some harmful 
pollutants like CO, NO2, and SO3 in the atmosphere that can lead 
to diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. One of the cities that 
seriously faces the problem of air pollution is Tehran. So, air 
pollution prediction for this city is of great importance and may 
lead to provide proper actions and controlling strategies. In this 
paper, we are going to use Vector Auto Regression (VAR) model 
to forecast daily concentrations of air pollutions in Tehran city for 
one day ahead. Since there are some correlations between air 
pollutants, it seems to get better results in forecasting if we get use
of these correlations. So our approach is to use a VAR model which 
considers the impact of variables on each other. For choosing the 
right variables in our model, we will use a causality test.
Experimental results demonstrate the high efficiency of the 
proposed approach in forecasting the concentrations of air 
pollutions in Tehran city.
